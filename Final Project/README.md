My final project is a website that will be used to host a podcast or series of podcasts.

There is a series of tables in a database that will store user accounts for the podcast Creators, relevant information on uploaded podcasts,
comments that will be tied to podcasts. 

Comments can be made by registered users and unregistered users. If the registered user is logged when they comment on a podcast,
that comment will be viewable on both the podcast page, and the users profile page.

All users can submit podcasts, after the user has, they become a creator, and are visible on the homepage.

The Admin account, which is automatically created with a password of admin, acts as a moderator. They can delete comments, podcasts,
and user accounts.
